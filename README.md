<i>lexiQL</i> is an open-source GraphQL prototyping tool that visualizes your relational database and facilitates GraphQL API prototyping and configuration, allowing developers to to optimize their queries and transition away from RESTful APIs. The tool takes a relational database input and uses it to generate the respective GraphQL schemas alongside an interactive GUI that displays all of the tables in a database, including primary/foreign key relationships between tables, as well as each table’s columns and associated data types.
